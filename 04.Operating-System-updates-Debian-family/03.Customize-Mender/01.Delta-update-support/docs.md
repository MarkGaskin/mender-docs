! Please note we provide these manual steps as an example only for creating Delta images on Debian-based distros.
! For a delta integration tested in our pipelines, please use Yocto to generate your images with delta.

You have access to robust delta updates if you are using [Mender Professional](https://mender.io/product/features?target=_blank) or
[Mender Enterprise](https://mender.io/product/features?target=_blank). This section describes how to enable delta updates on your devices by installing the `mender-binary-delta` Update Module with your Yocto Project build.

Once your devices support installing delta updates, see [Create a Delta update Artifact](../../../06.Artifact-creation/05.Create-a-Delta-update-Artifact/docs.md) for a tutorial on creating a delta update from two Operating System updates.

## Prerequisites

To use delta update, you must be using a read-only root filesystem. There are several ways of achieving this, which is out of this tutorial's scope. Generally speaking, ensure the bootloader and the `/etc/fstab` don't contain any `rw` reference.

You will need the binaries from the downloaded content both on the host and the device.
More information on where to place every file in the sections below.

For additional troubleshooting, you can check the [Delta updates troubleshooting guide](../../../301.Troubleshoot/03.Mender-Client/docs.md#delta-updates).

## Download `mender-binary-delta`

If you are using *Hosted Mender*, download the `mender-binary-delta` archive with the following
command:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender-binary-delta/%/mender-binary-delta-%.tar"/mender-binary-delta-->
```bash
HOSTED_MENDER_EMAIL="myusername@example.com"
curl -u $HOSTED_MENDER_EMAIL -O https://downloads.customer.mender.io/content/hosted/mender-binary-delta/1.5.0/mender-binary-delta-1.5.0.tar.xz
```

Replace the value of `HOSTED_MENDER_EMAIL` with the email address you used to sign up on *hosted Mender*, then enter your hosted Mender password when prompted to proceed.

!!! If you signed up using your Google or GitHub login, use the email address linked to that account and enter `x` as the password.

On the other hand, if you are using *on-premise Mender Enterprise*, download using the following
command:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender-binary-delta/%/mender-binary-delta-%.tar"/mender-binary-delta-->
```bash
MENDER_ENTERPRISE_USER=<your.user>
curl -u $MENDER_ENTERPRISE_USER -O https://downloads.customer.mender.io/content/on-prem/mender-binary-delta/1.5.0/mender-binary-delta-1.5.0.tar.xz
```

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender-binary-delta-%.tar.xz"/mender-binary-delta-->
The archive `mender-binary-delta-1.5.0.tar.xz` contains the binaries needed to generate and apply deltas.

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender-binary-delta-%.tar.xz"/mender-binary-delta-->
Unpack the `mender-binary-delta-1.5.0.tar.xz` in your home directory:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender-binary-delta-%.tar.xz"/mender-binary-delta-->
```bash
tar xvf mender-binary-delta-1.5.0.tar.xz
```

The file structure should look like this:

```text
├── aarch64
│   ├── mender-binary-delta
│   └── mender-binary-delta-generator
├── arm
│   ├── mender-binary-delta
│   └── mender-binary-delta-generator
├── licenses
│   └── ...
└── x86_64
    ├── mender-binary-delta
    └── mender-binary-delta-generator
```

### The `mender-binary-delta-generator`

You will need this binary on the host to [create a delta between two artifacts](../../../06.Artifact-creation/05.Create-a-Delta-update-Artifact/docs.md) locally.

!!! The enterprise plan allows auto generation of [delta images directly on the mender server](../../../06.Artifact-creation/05.Server-side-generation-of-Delta-Artifacts/docs.md).

Copy the generator compatible with your workstation architecture to `/usr/bin`; for a `x86_64` one, it should look like this:

<!--AUTOVERSION: "mender-binary-delta-%"/mender-binary-delta-->
```bash
sudo cp mender-binary-delta-1.5.0/x86_64/mender-binary-delta-generator /usr/bin
```

### Integrate `mender-binary-delta` into your image

Delta updates require the `mender-binary-delta` Update Module and the configuration file (`mender-binary-delta.conf`) on the device side. The steps on how to achieve this will depend on the way you're generating the image. We'll present only the location where you need to place the files.

Copy the `mender-binary-delta` binary into `/usr/share/mender/modules/v3/` on your device from the content you downloaded in the [previous step](#download-mender-binary-delta). Please ensure you're copying the binary from the directory specifying your architecture.

The `mender-binary-delta.conf` is a configuration on the device telling the update module the location of A/B partitions. It must be generated and placed in `/etc/mender/mender-binary-delta.conf`.

The content of the `mender-binary-delta.conf` configuration file is case-dependent. Below is an example of how it might look, but you might need different `/dev/*` locations depending on your device's name:

```json
{
  "RootfsPartA": "/dev/mmcblk0p2",
  "RootfsPartB": "/dev/mmcblk0p3"
}
```
